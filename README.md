# Install and use

In order to install, clone this repository and run:

npm install
// OR
yarn install
This was made with Expo, so you need it to run. To do it, run:

expo start
// OR if you have it locally
npx expo start
This starts the Metro Bundler. You can simulate the app in an Android emulator (such as in Android Studio) or in your own device, Android or iOS powered, by downloading the Expo App.
